            <h2>NICENO-CONSTANTINOPOLITAN CREED</h2>
                <p>We believe in one God,
                    the Father almighty,
                    maker of heaven and earth,
                    of all things visible and invisible.</p>
                <p>
                And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
                    the only Son of God,
                    begotten from the Father before all ages,
                        God from God,
                        Light from Light,
                        true God from true God,
                    begotten, not made;
                    of the same essence as the Father.
                    Through him all things were made.
                    For us and for our salvation
                        he came down from heaven;
                        he became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary,
                        and was made human.
                        He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate;
                        he suffered and was buried.
                        The third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures.
                        He ascended to heaven
                        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
                        He will come again with glory
                        to judge the living and the dead.
                        His kingdom will never end.
                </p>

                <p>
            
                And we believe in the Holy Spirit,
                    the Lord, the giver of life.
                    He proceeds from the Father and the Son,
                    and with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified.
                    He spoke through the prophets.
                    We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.
                    We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
                    We look forward to the resurrection of the dead,
                    and to life in the world to come. <br>Amen.</p>
                
                <h2>APOSTLES' CREED</h2>
                <p>
                I believe in God, the Father almighty,
                 creator of heaven and earth.
                </p>

                <p>
                 I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
                who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
                and born of the virgin Mary.
                He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                was crucified, died, and was buried;
                he descended to hell.
                The third day he rose again from the dead.
                He ascended to heaven
                and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
                From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
                </p>

                <p>
                I believe in the Holy Spirit,
                the holy catholic church,
                the communion of saints,
                the forgiveness of sins,
                the resurrection of the body,
                and the life everlasting. Amen.
                </p>
                <h2>PSEUDO-ATHANASIAN CREED</h2>
                <p>
                    Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith. Which faith unless every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence. For there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Ghost uncreated. The Father infinite; the Son infinite; and the Holy Ghost infinite. The Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal. As also there are not three uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite. So likewise the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Ghost Almighty. And yet they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty. So the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords; but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; So are we forbidden by the catholic religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is before, or after another; none is greater, or less than another. But the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal. So that in all things, as aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity.

</p><p>Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God, of the Substance [Essence] of the Father; begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Substance [Essence] of his mother, born in the world. Perfect God; and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood. Who although he is God and Man; yet he is not two, but one Christ. One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God. One altogether; not by confusion of Substance [Essence]; but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ; Who suffered for our salvation; descended into hell; rose again the third day from the dead. He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the living and the dead. At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies; And shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire. This is the catholic faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.

            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>The Nicene Creed was created by consensus at the First Council of Nicaea, AD 325, and amended at the First Council of Contantinople, AD 381,
                councils convened by Constantine I and Theodosius I respectively.
                <br>The schism between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches originated from "filioque", or a later addition to the creed 
                that said that the Holy Spirit also proceeds from the Son instead of just from the Father.
           
            </p>

            <p>The Apostles' Creed probably predates the Nicene Creed. In aforetimes it was believed that this creed
                was written by the apostles. It was even divided into 12 "articles", each assigned to an apostle. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
                The Pseudo-Athanasian Creed is named after St. Athanasius but wasn't actually written by him. 
                It codifies the traditional formulation of the Trinity as dogma.
                <br>It is designed to be a condemnation of Arianism, which says Jesus is a created being.
                <br>(A side note: I did not realize how ginormous this creed is until now.)
            

            </p>
            <h2>ADDENDA</h2>
            <p>
                Most denominations affirm these creeds, or, if not the creeds, the beliefs contained
                in the creeds. Denominations that don't include the Latter-Day Saints, the Jehovah's Witnesses,
                Oneness Pentecostals, and Unitarians. The Eastern Orthodox generally don't affirm the versions of the creeds 
                that affirm the procession of the Spirit from the Son.

            </p>
            <p>
               Also, the word "catholic" in these creeds does not necessarily refer to the Roman Catholic Church.
               The word means "all-embracing". Protestants think that catholic refers to the true, <em>invisible</em> Christian church that transcends lesser doctrinal divisions, and this definition
               allows for many denominations to claim part in the "one, holy, catholic, apostolic church".
