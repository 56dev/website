        Yesterday on Twitter I shared the following video: 
        </p>
        <iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Js4NiTFq9Pw" title="Why divergent thinkers beat geniuses in the real world | David Epstein" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            As someone who was, as the alternative title states, in danger in "overfitting" the way I look at myself, 
            my past, and my aspirations to a certain way, this video was an eye-opener. I wish this 
            blog post to communicate a few more of my ideas regarding that topic. My audience, today, is 
            people like me who get easily <b>discouraged, burnt-out, and regretful</b>, especially 
            "former gifted kids" who are afraid that they have lost the advantage they 
            had way back in elementary, and, some days, are unable to let go of that, and they 
            always compare themselves to others who they think handled their gift better. Nevertheless, I hope 
            anyone with self-esteem issues regarding intelligence can, I hope, benefit.

            First, a brief summary of the video above, and why it sparked a wave of inspiration in me: 
            the first point is that a person's development is not a linear trajectory, implying that, what 
            seems to be a huge headstart may not necessarily pay off in dividends later on. Rather, 
            development is more complex. Part of the complexity is that these headstarts often come in narrow, 
            specialized, technical fields. Indeed, it may seem linear in these sorts of fields. However, 
            the real world is what David Epstein (<em>not that Epstein</em>) calls a wicked learning environment. 
            This kind of learning environment is where objectives are unclear and feedback may be scrambled or inaccurate -- 
            generally a very unwelcoming environment, as opposed to a kind environment which gives a clear objective 
            and clear feedback, like math: all you have to do is to internalize the strategies you need to get you to your 
            desired solution. Epstein gives chess as an example: grandmasters are able to play well because their 
            brains are wired to quickly interpret patterns where we would just see a mess of pieces. For the wicked world, in contrast, we need a 
            "broad training base", where we form "conceptual frameworks" that we can adapt to a myriad of different situations. This is 
            especially viable in the <b>Information Age</b>, because of the glut of free information available; whereas in previous ages 
            <b>specialists</b> would contribute more, nowadays it's <b>generalists</b>, people who are able to form frameworks and skills that they 
            can generalize across fields, who contribute. This is how the <b>GameBoy</b> was created: 
            integrating old technologies to form something new. Indeed, many new and unusual things are really just novel combinations of usual things.  Finally, to end the video, David Epstein urges us to recognize that <em>the world is changing</em>,
            and planning for what or who we want to be in 10 to 20 years is essentially like making plans for a stranger in a different universe! That is, 
            thinking that not having the necessary technical knowledge now would basically end up destroying your future is an untenable worldview. Rather, 
            instead of comparing ourselves to other people, we should rather compare ourselves to who we were yesterday, and move based on that.

            It is, altogether, a very encouraging video. It inspired me to more deeply form some of my own thoughts on the matter, which I created 
            during times when I reflect on this feeling on regret, first, for example, the idea that narrow, technical intelligence does depend on 
            environment as well as genetics. You may not be inherently less intelligent: rather, you may have just lacked the kind environment 
            and the resources needed to foster this kind of thing. I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA">this video by Veritasium</a>
            does a good job of clarifying what a "kind environment" is, even if he does not use that term in the video. In essence, expertise is recognition, 
            acquired through repetition and immediate feedback. In fields where you are unable to train recognition in this way, even experts may end up unable to predict accurately. 
            If you were unable to train recognition in that way as a kid, that's fine. Don't be disappointed you don't yet know how to play a complex piece on the piano. 
            Actually, I believe someone once said that the main benefit of playing the piano in your childhood is your early exposure to situations which 
            require <em>perseverance</em>. And I think any person, from the old to the young, can learn to be a master-perseverer, no matter their piano-skill. 
            In any case, if this is you, then it is not your fault that you lacked the necessary environment.

            But whatever you want to blame your regrets on, you'll probably never get rid of them, even 
            by well- also consider you may not want regrets. You may be in the point 
            of your life where you desperately want to be good at <em>something</em>, and yet, you feel that it is 
            too late to be so.
