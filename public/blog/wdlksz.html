        Yesterday on Twitter I shared the following video: 
        </p>
        <iframe width="320" height="180" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Js4NiTFq9Pw" title="Why divergent thinkers beat geniuses in the real world | David Epstein" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            As someone who was, as the alternative title states, in danger in "overfitting" the way I look at myself, 
            my past, and my aspirations to a certain way, this video was an eye-opener. I wish this 
            blog post to communicate a few more of my ideas regarding that topic. My audience, today, is 
            people like me who get easily <b>discouraged, burnt-out, and regretful</b>, especially 
            "former gifted kids" who are afraid that they have lost the advantage they 
            had way back in elementary, and, some days, are unable to let go of that, and they 
            always compare themselves to others who they think handled their gift better. Nevertheless, I hope 
            anyone with self-esteem issues regarding intelligence can benefit. 
        </p>

            First, a brief summary of the video above, and why it sparked a wave of inspiration in me: 
            the first point is that a person's development is not a linear trajectory, implying that, what 
            seems to be a huge headstart may not necessarily pay off in dividends later on. Rather, 
            development is more complex. Part of the complexity is that these headstarts often come in narrow, 
            specialized, technical fields. Indeed, it may seem linear in these sorts of fields. However, 
            the real world is what David Epstein (<em>not that Epstein</em>) calls a wicked learning environment. 
            This kind of learning environment is where objectives are unclear and feedback may be scrambled or inaccurate -- 
            generally a very unwelcoming environment, as opposed to a kind environment which gives a clear objective 
            and clear feedback, like math: all you have to do is to internalize the strategies you need to get you to your 
            desired solution. Epstein gives chess as an example: grandmasters are able to play well because their 
            brains are wired to quickly interpret patterns where we would just see a mess of pieces. For the wicked world, in contrast, we need a 
            "broad training base", where we form "conceptual frameworks" that we can adapt to a myriad of different situations. This is 
            especially viable in the <b>Information Age</b>, because of the glut of free information available; whereas in previous ages 
            <b>specialists</b> would contribute more, nowadays it's <b>generalists</b>, people who are able to form frameworks and skills that they 
            can generalize across fields, who contribute. This is how the <b>GameBoy</b> was created: 
            integrating old technologies to form something new. Indeed, many new and unusual things are really just novel combinations of usual things.  Finally, to end the video, David Epstein urges us to recognize that <em>the world is changing</em>,
            and planning for what or who we want to be in 10 to 20 years is essentially like making plans for a stranger in a different universe! That is, 
            thinking that not having the necessary technical knowledge now would basically end up destroying your future is an untenable worldview. Rather, 
            instead of comparing ourselves to other people, we should rather compare ourselves to who we were yesterday, and move based on that.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is, altogether, a very encouraging video, especially his last words, on how, if you don't know with 100% certainty 
            where you will end up (none of us do), it is a lost cause to even feel behind. Again, a person's development is obscured, complex, and 
            non-linear. Rather, it is better to incrementally increase our knowledge base (perhaps, our wisdom too?), so that we are 
            more knowledgeable than we were yesterday. This is the only comparison that matters and that we should expend mental energy on.
            That is some general life advice that I feel applies greatly to myself. 
            Think about it: some people just seem so much better in technical fields than I am. 
            Paralysis comes: I do nothing out of disappointment.
            And what do I accomplish in the end? Nothing. 
            This, as opposed to if one steadily grows and grows -- and then, perhaps they won't 
            be a chess grandmaster or best in the world at solving rubik's cubes, but they will 
            just be astonished at how far they've come. All of human ambition can be likened to climbing 
            mountains. You look at what's ahead and you quail in fear. And you wonder at those who 
            went before, and have succeeded. Perhaps at this point, you feel that because they started 
            earlier, that is why they are so far ahead. But why don't you start, little by little? 
            In a week or two, look down at the ground so far away. 
        </p>
            
        <p>            
            This is alright to motivate you to progress. But remember that mountains aren't a 
            good picture because they are still vaguely linear; individual human progression is still 
            infinitely more complex than climbing mountains. In fact, any metaphors
            concerning a human's progress (really, anything about a human) 
            are, I believe, inherently inadequate, because there is 
            nothing else in the world like the human soul. But they may serve to highlight certain 
            aspects of it well enough.

        <p>
            You may also still be nevertheless discouraged, because it's alright to be become 
            <em>better</em>, but what if you want to be the <em>best?</em> Or among the best, 
            in any case. If you're anything like me, 
            you want to become the best at <em>something</em>, and you become discouraged because you see 
            particular cases like in Chess, where if you didn't start when your age was in the single-digits, 
            then say goodbye to becoming a grandmaster. That's just how it is. In following this thread, let's 
            focus on technical things one aspires to be the best at, such as competitive math, competitive programming, 
            and even videogames. Yes, 
            why video games are a hooker for many people is because they give you a clear objective, 
            immediate feedback (remember, kind environments?), and provide lots of opportunity for 
            technical advancement. Whether it be a strategic RPG or a first-person shooter, or even something 
            as ludicrous as stabbing people with lego swords (Minecraft, heh, I love you), there is a clear 
            goal to be achieved, clear standards to base yourself on. This logic remains unchanged for competitive 
            math and programming. People here are, essentially, playing a videogame, 
            and they participate because they experienced something analogous 
            to you finding a game that you happen to be good at (or a game that 
            makes you feel good at it, in any case), and so are motivated to feed time to.
            So, why do we value the latter two more? Well, math and programming are legitimately 
            useful skills to have, while 360 no-scoping n00bs isn't, so the reasoning goes. 
            Yet, don't videogames also train your reflexes, team-building skills, and reaction time, which 
            is very handy for people who aren't athletic?
            
            So why do we look down on people who spend their lives 
            playing videogames? Perhaps, they are donating too much time to and overfitting themselves to a certain environment that won't end up 
            helping them that much? But how does this logic not apply to math or programming champions? It is well-known, 
            in the latter case, that competitive programming, past a certain point, ends up not 
            being beneficial at all in making you a good, industry-level software engineer. Indeed, it 
            can internalize <em>bad</em> programming practices, such as preoptimization and 
            obscure variable names, all nonos, any software engineer will tell you.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I think is the solution here is that the best of the best in all three of those examples
            simply found something that they were good at. Not to say it's all talent and no work; 
            they worked hard as hell for what they achieved! I think part of the reason young people 
            often prevail in these fields is that youths don't have many obligations other than their choice of 
            videogame or competition to think about, so they can dedicate loads of time to it! 
            
            I think that, if you were to ask them, they would 
            agree that these skills are most excellently combined with a wider knowledge base, so that 
            these skills may be integrated into the real world, as opposed to building these skills 
            and only these skills by themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe you're at the point in your life where you don't care about the real world yet, 
            and you just want to feel like you're the best in something. In this case, I 
            have nothing except to remind you that there are more important things in life, the universe, 
            and YOU. Laugh if you want, but there are tales of people selling their souls to Satan just so they 
            can get material wealth, and, yes, wordly expertise. You don't want to grow up and realize that you've 
            massively underperformed on all the other important areas of life, areas that you still need to live 
            a fulfilling and happy life, in pursuit of this one single technical goal. That, I think, is the worse 
            regret out of the two.

            Perhaps you just want praise or recognition. In my case, I've always
            treated being the best as being 
            recognized, no matter how niche or small the community, 
            as respectable and praiseworthy.
            I say, both to you and myself, there are many things to be said for praise, 
            but there is far more to be said for a good soul.
