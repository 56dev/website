        <h1>🎶 MUSIC</h1>
        <p>
            Music is quite nice. So here are some songs I like. Obviously 
            not exhaustive, but generally songs good/interesting enough for me 
            to comment on them or take the trouble to list them.
        </p>
        <p>This page does <em>not</em> contain music I created, though if I 
        do start creating music, it will of course have its dedicated page.</p>

                    <p>
                        Getting recommended this song was what ultimately persuaded me to 
                        try Neon Genesis Evangeleon. Of course, catching wind of angelic and Kabbalistic 
                        imagery (all esoteric stuff I'm weak for) helped as well, but this song -- isn't it just 
                        magnificient? The linked video is also a montage of many important events in the anime. It's 
                        arranged in a way so that it's pretty much impossible to get spoiled watching the video, 
                        but watching it now, knowing how everything ends up ... it really just makes the song 
                        hit that much harder.

                    <p>
                    This is a very nostalgic-sounding song I found in, oddly enough, a Lain playlist. I love the recognizable ever-present guitar strumming of this song.
                    A very chill and happy song, great to walk down a sparsely populated afternoon street to.

                    <summary>Thoughts: Fish, fish, and more fish</summary>
                    <p>
                    The song's title translates directly to "chasing fish", which must have contributed to 
                    somebody's decision to put it in the playlist I found it: A Shimeji Simulation Fan OST.
                    To me, at least, the singer has an unconventional vocal style, but that by itself invokes a certain charm, like a 
                    child-like, fun, amateur, or nevertheless genuine charm. The general tune of the song 
                    is very catchy and quite evocative of the underground internet subculture this song was birthed 
                    in, somehow. I particularly enjoy the guitar pattern and the chorus. The band is Super Social Socials (renamed 
                    from Anti Social Sandals) and has apparently only existed for 4 years as of the time of writing, according 
                    to this <a href="https://officialgf.com/2024/11/24/who-is-sss/">article</a>. Generally very cool to see 
                    underground music that sounds as good as this.
