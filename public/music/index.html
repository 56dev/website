        <p>
            Music is quite nice. So here are some songs I like. Obviously 
            not exhaustive, but generally songs good/interesting enough for me 
            to comment on them or take the trouble to list them.
        </p>
        <p>This page does <em>not</em> contain music I created, though if I 
        do start creating music, it will of course have its dedicated page.</p>

                    <p>
                    This is the first song from PinocchioP that I was recommended. It is insanely catchy -- I couldn't get 
                    it out of my head for days after first listening to it. I think the song has something to do 
                    about online friends, too, which is interesting. Not that I would really know what it's talking about -- 
                    it's in Japanese and I haven't analyzed the English lyrics. ü•π

                    If you've ever played Yume 2kki Online even a little bit before, you probably know how much people 
                    want to visit Lavender Waters. I haven't logged into it for a while by now ... but I hope people still 
                    want to visit this place. It's peaceful. It's like paradise. But really pink. Someone find the pixel 
                    artist of that place and reward them, please.

                    <p>
                        Getting recommended this song was what ultimately persuaded me to 
                        try Neon Genesis Evangelion. Of course, catching wind of angelic and Kabbalistic 
                        imagery (all esoteric stuff I'm weak for) helped as well, but this song -- isn't it just 
                        magnificient? The linked video is also a montage of many important events in the anime. It's 
                        arranged in a way so that it's pretty much impossible to get spoiled watching the video, 
                        but watching it now, knowing how everything ends up ... it really just makes the song 
                        hit that much harder.

                    <p>
                        This is basically a slower piano + violin rendition of Cruel Angel's Thesis. 
                        So, why did I put it here? Aside from being a pretty good change of tone from the 
                        epicness of the intro theme, it is also the song that plays during the very end 
                        of the show: Episode 26. The ending to the show was controversial, but I truly loved it;
                        it was a beautiful, happy ending, and I think, to really appreciate this song, you should 
                        watch the show and see how it ends. I suppose the ending could have been clearer with the plot ... 
                        but ahhh, come on, this isn't an Evangelion blog post. Just listen to the music and enjoy. ^_^

                    This is a very nostalgic-sounding song I found in, oddly enough, a Lain playlist. I love the recognizable ever-present guitar strumming of this song.
                    A very chill and happy song, great to walk down a sparsely populated afternoon street to.

                    <summary>Thoughts: Fish, fish, and more fish</summary>
                    <p>
                    The song's title translates directly to "chasing fish", which must have contributed to 
                    somebody's decision to put it in the playlist I found it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay2d322lJ38">A Shimeji Simulation Fan OST</a>.
                    To me, at least, the singer has an unconventional vocal style, but that by itself invokes a certain charm, like a 
                    child-like, fun, amateur, or nevertheless genuine charm. The general tune of the song 
                    is very catchy and quite evocative of the underground internet subculture this song was birthed 
                    in, somehow. I particularly enjoy the guitar pattern and the chorus. The band is Super Social Sandals (renamed 
                    from Anti Social Sandals) and has apparently only existed for 4 years as of the time of writing, according 
                    to this <a href="https://officialgf.com/2024/11/24/who-is-sss/">article</a>. Generally very cool to see 
                    underground music that sounds as good as this.
