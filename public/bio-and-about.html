      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello there! My primary alias online is 56dev_.</p>

      <p>I chose it as my username because 56 matches my initials.</p> 

      <p>
        I live in Canada (Alberta, oilll babyy!!!!) and I'm a Christian. 
        I first immigrated here at a very young age. I have been online-schooled ever since the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have enjoyed programming (specifically, making progress on programming, which is rare) ever 
        since I was introduced to it at around twelve years of age. My first dive into 
        programming was gamedev with C#. For many years,  due to many factors, progress 
        was regretfully slow. Currently, I am learning C++ and it is shaping up to be one of my 
        favorite languages!
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, I enjoy art; my main inspiration for art,
        or even just the art I enjoy looking at most, has, for the past
        year or two, been Tsukumizu's art, as well as similar styles that mimic the
        cute artstyle and its homey, unique je ne sais quoi, although lately I've been
        starting to branch out to more diverse styles of art.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love eggs for breakfast! I've had them practically every day of my life!
        Don't believe anyone who says it isn't healthy, my body weight is in a healthy range.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a little bit more ambition and delusional faith than I rightfully deserve, but I have 
        faith that this faith will pay off. Unconvinced? Well, I have the faith that this faith
        in this faith will pay off. And then I have the faith in this faith in this faith ...

      <h2>About this site</h2>
      <p> This site was created a long time ago by now and 
        must have undergone at least 3 complete redesigns. Its intention is pretty much
        the same, though: it's a personal site doubling as a portfolio site. all my projects, 
        blog posts, writings, art, etc. will live here or be linked here. super cool. guess now i've gotta focus on filling it up.
      </p>

      <p>alright, thanks for reading, hope you enjoy going through the rest of this place :)</p>
