      <h2>About this site</h2>
      <p> This site was created a long time ago by now and 
        must have undergone at least 3 complete redesigns. Its intention is pretty much
        the same, though: it's a personal site doubling as a portfolio site. all my projects, 
        blog posts, writings, art, etc. will live here or be linked here. super cool. guess now i've gotta focus on filling it up.
      </p>

      <p>alright, thanks for reading, hope you enjoy going through the rest of this place :)</p>
