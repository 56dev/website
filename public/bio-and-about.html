      <p>Now, about this site. This site was created a while ago by now and 
        must have undergone at least 3 complete redesigns. Its intention is pretty much
        the same, though; it's a personal site doubling as a portfolio site where I can show
        my projects, thoughts, writings, opinions, art, etc. Pretty simple idea!
      </p>

      <p>With all that out of the way, I hope you enjoy perusing this corner of the internet. ^_^</p>
      <p>My links and email are back in the homepage!</p>

      <h2>DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <p>This site takes inspiration from Web 1.0. We don't like unnecessary animations here! I try to condense as much information as possible without making it an eyesore.</p>
